This app blends data from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) and

## Set-up

- Fork and clone the repo
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to develop

- The HTML and CSS have been supplied if you wish to focus on the programming and not the UI, but you should feel free to customise your application as you see fit.

## Objectives

- [ ] Use HTML and CSS from [Mini Weather App](https://github.com/constructorlabs/mini-weatherapp) covert the HTML into individual React components (stateful and stateless).

- [ ] Using the API keys from previous exercise write the data loading logic to make requests to the Open Weather and Unsplash APIs to retrieve the weather and images using `fetch`.

- [ ] Implement data flow in the app to display information received APIs in the components created in step 1. Ensure that a click on a thumbnail image, updates the main image.

Since in this exercise the HTML and CSS are already provided for you, it would be easier to implement the static page layout using components first and add the data to it afterwards.

## Support

- If you are stuck for more than 20 minutes, ask us for help.
- We recommend you keep developer tools open at all times and keep eye on any error messages. Developing is much easier if you fix any errors as soon as you encounter them.
